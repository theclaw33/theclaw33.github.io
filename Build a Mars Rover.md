# Build a Mars Rover

**The Mars Rover is a battery-powered machine that uses a geared motor to power over rocks, craters, and other obstacles. This project demonstrates the concepts of traction, torque,  circuits, and polarity.**

**Introduction**

Imagine you were able to pick up a remote control car while its wheels are still spinning. You would suddenly hear the motor become more high-pitched as it spins faster. This is because the wheels no longer have **traction** with the ground to make the car move forward, and so they’re able to turn faster. The  **force** that pushes the wheels of the car around in a circle is called **torque**. When the **torque** is high, meaning it is pushing the wheels of the car around their **axle** harder, the speed will be lower. When the speed is higher, the **torque** will be lower.

Now imagine that you have created a vehicle that is meant to travel along the surface of the planet Mars. There are many rocks, bumps, and crevices for the Rover to drive over. It’s not enough for the Rover to be fast, it must also have the ability to increase its **torque** and power over these obstacles. The gearbox attached to the motor would help the Rover produce the **torque** needed to climb over these challenging obstacles. All the  **torque**  and **energy** is transferred to the wheels, then to the surface of Mars. That **energy** would be wasted if the wheels had no grip and spun freely. We must increase the grip, or **traction**, of the wheels to effectively transfer all of the torque. **Traction** is the **force** used to generate motion between a body (the Mars Rover) and a surface (the ground). In a gas-powered car, the bumps and grooves on the treads of the tires help create this **traction** with the road so that the car can grip the road and push itself along.

**Instructions**

**Step 1:** Use a 5” piece of masking tape to attach geared motor to back of craft stick. Be sure to place the motor so that the pen caps are at the very back of the craft stick and the yellow motor case is all the way at the back of the stick.

**Step 2:** Wrap the rubber band around the battery lengthwise and use a 5” piece of tape to attach it to the top of the craft stick. Be sure that the geared motor and the battery are both on the same side of the craft stick. The battery must not touch the motor whatsoever.

**Step 3:** Center the straw horizontally at the top end of the craft stick opposite the motor. Use two 2” pieces of tape to secure the straw to the craft stick, one horizontal and one vertical along the craft stick. Insert the dowel through the straw.

**Step 4:** Press the pen caps and the dowel into the very center of each of the four foam wheels on the flat sides of the wheels. The dowel and the pen caps should go all the way through each of the foam wheels and stick out from them slightly, about 1/2” each. Cover the tip of each point of the dowel and pen caps using 1” of tape, pressing it firmly against each foam wheel.

Connect your motor and battery by placing one paper clip between the rubber band and the end of the battery (terminal).

**Note for Parents**

Once the battery dies, dispose of it properly. When using the Rover, ensure that hair longer than shoulder length is tied back as it can get caught in the motor. If the motor or battery become extremely hot, disconnect them immediately.

**Materials**

Craft stick, dowel, straw, rubber band, battery, geared motor with pen caps and paper clips, foam wheels, masking tape.

## **Concepts & Terms**

The  **_force_** that pushes the wheels of the car around in a circle is called **_torque_**. When the **_torque_** is high, meaning it is pushing the wheels of the car around their **_axle_**  (rods that run through the centers of the wheels) harder, the speed will be lower. When the speed is higher, the **_torque_** will be lower. The gearbox attached to the motor helps the Rover produce the **_torque_** needed to climb over obstacles. All the  **_torque_**/**_energy_**  generated by the **_motor_** is transferred to the wheels and then to the surface of Mars. That energy would be wasted if the wheels had no grip and spun freely. We must increase the grip, or **_traction_**, of the wheels to effectively transfer all of the torque. **_Traction_** is the **_force_** used to generate motion between a body (the Mars Rover) and a surface (the ground). On a gas-powered car, the treads of the tires help create this **_traction_** with the road. You can reverse the **_polarity_** in your **_circuit_**  by switching the paper clips to the opposite sides of the battery. This causes the **_electrons_** in your **_circuit_** to flow in the opposite direction through the geared **_motor_**.



**Questions**

1.  You can wrap a rubber band around your foam wheels in order to increase traction. What other kinds of changes can you make to increase their traction?
    
2.  How does your Rover move differently when you reverse the polarity?
