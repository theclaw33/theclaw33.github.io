# Virtual CSW Projects

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.


# Project Menu

Each project comes includes:

 1. Instructional handout
 2. Step-by-step video guide
 3. Kit of materials

## Project #1

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

## Project #2

All your files and folders are presented as a tree in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the tree.

## Project #3

You can rename the current file by clicking the file name in the navigation bar or by clicking the **Rename** button in the file explorer.
